      <h2>What is RadMap?</h2>
      <div class="line"></div>
      <p>
        RadMap is a desktop application that simulates radiation transport in matter.
        RadMap allows you to calculate external dose inflicted by photons to a person in a
        customizable environment. RadMap uses a full Monte Carlo algorithm that runs on all
        cores of your computer in parallel to deliver the result as quickly as possible.

      <h2>The RadMap workflow</h2>
      <div class="line"></div>
      <p>Calculate dose in five easy steps:</p>
      <h5>1. CUSTOMIZE YOUR ENVIRONMENT</h5>
      <p>What does the environment look like? The RadMap interface lets you build the environment
      by placing boxes, cylinders and tubes of different materials in a virtual world.
      <br/>
      Do you need a special material? No problem. RadMap lets you design your own materials and
      compunds if you cannot find what you need among the hundreds of predefined materials in
      the RadMap materials data base.</p>
      <h5>2. Place sources</h5>
      <p>What parts of the environment are radioactive? Assign one or more of several hundreds of
      pre-defined radiactive isotopes to some of the building blocks of your environment. Set the
      activity of the sources in a suitable unit.</p>
      <h5>3. Place dose maps</h5>
      <p>In what parts of the environment would you like to know the dose rate? Place dosemaps in
      these locations. The dose map registers the flux of gamma radiation through these
      locations and converts the flux to dose rate.</p>
      <h5>4. Simulate!</h5>
      <p>Do you want a quick calculation with a rough estimate of the dose rates or do you want a
      slower more accurate calculation? Select the number of primary decays you wish to simulate.
      <br />
      The more decays the longer simulation but the better precision in the result. Hit the
      Simulate button!</p>
      <h5>5. Collect the results</h5>
      <p>The simulation is done! Browse through the dose maps and se the registered dose rate
      presented with the statistical uncertainty. Export the result as a PDF.</p>

    <section id="faq">
      <h2>FAQ</h2>
      <div class="line"></div>
      <br/>
      <h6>How do I get a time-limited license?</h6>
      <p>Through the RadMap interface you can generate an installation-specific file that you send to
      us. Follow the instructions in the user manual.</p><br/>

      <h6>Why is the installer zip file so large?</h6>
      <p>To accurately simulate radiation, RadMap requires information of a lage amount of particle
      interactions, material properties and radioactive sources. This data takes up a lot of space.
      The executables make up only a small fraction of the size.</p><br/>

      <h6>Why are there two installers?</h6>
      <p>Radmap consists of two parts: a client GUI and a calculation server. We keep these in separate
      installers since the server contains all the data and takes a bit of time to install.</p><br/>

      <h6>Why is the installation path hardcoded to C:\RadMap?</h6>
      <p>The server needs read and write access to its installation folder and sub-folders. This is a simple way to achieve this. We also want to help our partners as quickly as possible with
      trouble shooting and bug-fixing. This is much easier if we know where to find the installation.</p>
